# 🕰️ Tempora - Clock Synchronization System

A creative JavaScript application that analyzes and synchronizes various clocks around town with the Grand Clock Tower. Features beautiful visualizations, comprehensive analysis, and real-time clock representations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Tempora checks all the clocks in a town and synchronizes them with the Grand Clock Tower. The system calculates time differences, provides visual feedback, and generates synchronization recommendations.

### 📊 Current Clock Data
- **Grand Clock Tower**: 15:00 (Reference Time)
- **Town Square Clock**: 14:45 (-15 minutes)
- **Railway Station Clock**: 15:05 (+5 minutes)  
- **Church Bell Tower**: 15:00 (Synchronized ✅)
- **Market Clock**: 14:40 (-20 minutes)

### 🔢 Time Differences Array
```javascript
[-15, 5, 0, -20]
```

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- ⏰ Time difference calculation between town clocks and Grand Clock Tower
- 📈 Comprehensive statistical analysis
- 🔧 Intelligent synchronization recommendations
- 🎨 Beautiful visual clock representations using HTML5 Canvas
- 📱 Responsive web interface with modern design
- 🔄 Real-time clock updates and simulations

### Visual Elements
- Interactive analog clocks with accurate time display
- Color-coded status indicators (green = synchronized, orange = ahead, red = behind)
- Modern gradient backgrounds and animations
- Real-time statistics dashboard
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### Key Enhancements:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Median calculations, synchronization rates, drift analysis
- **System Insights**: Intelligent recommendations based on analysis
- **Clock Management**: Add, remove, and update clocks dynamically
- **Configuration**: Import/export system configurations
- **Performance**: Analysis caching and history tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with descriptive messages

See [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed information about the refactoring improvements.


### Running the Refactored Version:
```bash
node app-refactored.js
npm run test-refactored
```

The refactored version offers enhanced features, better maintainability, and improved performance.

## 🔧 Core Components


### ClockSynchronizer Class
```javascript
const { ClockSynchronizer } = require('./app-refactored.js');
const clockSync = new ClockSynchronizer();
const differences = clockSync.calculateTimeDifferences();
// Returns: [-15, 5, 0, -20]
```

### Key Methods
- `timeToMinutes(timeString)` - Converts HH:MM to minutes since midnight
- `calculateTimeDifferences()` - Returns array of time differences
- `analyzeClocks()` - Comprehensive analysis with statistics
- `generateRecommendations()` - Synchronization instructions
- `displayResults()` - Formatted console output

## 📊 Analysis Output

The system provides detailed analysis including:

### Summary Statistics
- Total clocks monitored: 4
- Synchronized clocks: 1
- Clocks running ahead: 1  
- Clocks running behind: 2
- Maximum difference: 20 minutes
- Average difference: 10.0 minutes

### Synchronization Recommendations
- ✅ Church Bell Tower: Perfect synchronization - no adjustment needed
- ⏰ Town Square Clock: Move forward by 15 minutes
- ⏰ Railway Station Clock: Move backward by 5 minutes
- ⏰ Market Clock: Move forward by 20 minutes

## 🌐 Web Interface Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Analog Clocks**: Hand-drawn with accurate time representation
- **Status Cards**: Color-coded for easy status identification
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time summary metrics
- **Refresh Button**: Simulate clock variations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

npm run test-refactored
```

## 🔄 API Endpoints

### GET /api/clocks
Returns complete clock analysis data:
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "grandClockTower": "15:00",
    "clocks": [...],
    "summary": {...}
  },
  "recommendations": [...],
  "timeDifferences": [-15, 5, 0, -20]
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Clocks
Modify the `townClocks` array in `app.js`:
```javascript
this.townClocks = [
    { id: 5, time: "14:55", name: "Library Clock" },
    // ... existing clocks
];
```

### Changing Reference Time
Update the `grandClockTower` property:
```javascript
this.grandClockTower = "16:30"; // New reference time
```

### Styling Modifications
Edit the CSS in `index.html` to customize:
- Color schemes
- Layout arrangements  
- Animation effects
- Typography choices
